# New Feature Announcement: Workspace Sharing

We are excited to announce a new capability that will help teams collaborate more effectively. Starting today, you can share your projects with external stakeholders using the new Sharing feature.

## What is it?

Workspace Sharing allows you to invite clients, contractors, or partners to view specific parts of your project. This ensures that everyone stays on the same page without giving full access to your internal data.

## Key Benefits

- **Better Collaboration:** Keep everyone aligned on project status.
- **Security:** Control exactly what external users can see in the workspace.
- **Efficiency:** Stop sending manual email updates about project progress.

## How to use it

Simply go to your project settings, click on the "Share" button, and enter the email address of the person you want to invite. They will receive an email with a link to access the shared view.

We hope this new addition to our project management tool helps you achieve your goals faster!
