# New Feature: Workspace Sharing is Here

We’re launching **Workspace Sharing** to help you collaborate seamlessly with external partners without compromising security.

## What is it?

Workspace Sharing lets you give clients or contractors view-only access to specific parts of your Workspace. They get the context they need, and you keep your internal data secure.

## Why you’ll love it

- **Sarah (Enterprise Admin)** can rest easy knowing meticulous permissions control exactly what external guests can see—down to the specific Project or Task level.
- **Alex (Team Lead)** can stop spending Friday afternoons exporting status reports. Clients can now view the roadmap directly.
- **Mike (IC Engineer)** avoids context switching; he doesn’t have to update a separate tracker for stakeholders.

## How it works

1.  Navigate to **Workspace Settings**.
2.  Select **Sharing & Guests**.
3.  Invite your partner by email and set their granular permissions.

This feature is available today for all Business and Enterprise plans.
