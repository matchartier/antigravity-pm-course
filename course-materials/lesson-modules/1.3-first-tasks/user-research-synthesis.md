# User Research Synthesis: Top Pain Points

**Source:** 8 User Interviews (Oct 5-13, 2024)
**Personas:** Engineering, Design, Product, Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Enterprise Admin

## Executive Summary

Across all 8 interviews, users consistently cited **inefficiency in setup** (lack of templates) and **noise** (notifications) as their primary frustrations. **Dark mode** is the most requested feature for satisfaction/retention.

## Top 3 Pain Points

### 1. Lack of Templates (The "Blank Slate" Problem)

**Impact:** High Friction, Manual Work
Every single persona mentioned wasting time manually recreating project structures.

- **Sales:** "Copy-paste hell" for onboarding 30-day ramps.
- **Marketing:** Rebuilding campaign structures 3-4 times/month.
- **Design/CS:** Manually recreating "master checklists" for each new project/customer.
- **New Users:** "Stare at a blank screen and don't know what to do."

### 2. Notification Overload

**Impact:** Disengagement, Missed Signals
Users are receiving 40-70 notifications/day and turning them off entirely.

- **Key Quote:** "I've turned most notifications off... but then I miss critical updates."
- **Needs:** Smart batching, daily digests, and "Urgent vs. FYI" distinction.
- **Current State:** "Engineering team is drowning in notifications."

### 3. Missing Dark Mode

**Impact:** User Satisfaction, Physical Discomfort
Mentioned by 7/8 participants, often as the #1 request.

- **Context:** Users work late hours (engineers, sales across timezones, global marketing).
- **Quote:** "Bright white interface hurts my eyes." / "It's a running joke on our team Slack."
- **Status:** While cosmetic, it is a major detractor for power users currently.

## Other Notable Findings

- **Mobile Experience:** universally described as "clunky" or "rough", especially for on-the-go personas (Sales, CS, Execs).
- **Reporting:** Managers feel blind; manual reporting to VPs is a weekly time-sink.
