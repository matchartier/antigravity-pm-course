Subject: Onboarding Research: Why 40% of New Signups Churn

Hi Leadership Team,

We completed research into our 40% drop-off rate at the team invite step. The data shows a clear link between "solo" usage and churn, costing us ~$4k/mo in potential MRR.

**Key Insights**
New users are skipping the team invite (73% skip rate) because the UI treats it as an optional secondary step. This creates "solo users" who churn at 68% (vs 22% for teams) because they miss our core collaborative value. 34% of users incorrectly see TaskFlow as a personal task manager.

**Recommendation & Next Steps**
We should immediately redesign the invite flow to be the primary path, not an optional step.

- **Action:** Redesign invite screen + implement 24hr "nudge" email.
- **Impact:** Reduce solo behavior by 50%, saving ~$24k/year.
- **Timeline:** Design complete May 18, Ship end of May.

Best,
Sarah
