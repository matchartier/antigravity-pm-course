# TaskFlow Terminology & Style Guide

## Terminology
*   **Workspace:** The top-level container for an organization (NOT "Project", NOT "Account").
*   **Project:** A collection of tasks within a workspace.
*   **Task:** An individual unit of work (NOT "To-do", NOT "Item").
*   **Cycle:** A 2-week period of work (NOT "Sprint").
*   **Epic:** A large feature spanning multiple tasks.

## Personas
Always reference these standard personas in examples:
*   **Sarah (Enterprise Admin):** Cares about security, controls, governance.
*   **Mike (IC Engineer):** Cares about speed, keyboard shortcuts, flow.
*   **Alex (Team Lead):** Cares about visibility, reporting, team health.

## Writing Style
*   **Voice:** Professional but conversational. Confident, direct, helpful.
*   **Formatting:** Use bullet points for readability. Bold key terms.
*   **Grammar:** Active voice over passive voice. Oxford comma used.
*   **No Emojis:** Keep it clean and professional (unless internal fun comms).
*   **Real Examples:** proper nouns for people/teams (e.g., "Sarah", "Engineering Team" not "User", "Team").
